📌 Smart Attendance System Using QR Code

🔍 Project Description
The **Smart Attendance System Using QR Code** is a secure, cloud-based web application developed to automate attendance management in educational institutions.
It replaces manual attendance with **session-based QR codes**, ensuring **accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and high security**.


⚙️ How the System Works

* Teacher logs in and generates a **unique QR code** for a specific class/session
* QR code is **time-limited** to prevent misuse
* Students scan the QR code using their mobile devices
* Attendance is recorded **in real time**
* Data is securely stored and synced to the cloud
* Teachers can view, verify, and download attendance reports


🔐 Security Features

* Secure authentication using **Firebase Authentication**
* **Role-based access control** (Admin / Teacher / Student)
* Time-restricted QR codes to prevent proxy attendance
* Encrypted communication using **HTTPS & TLS**
* Secure cloud database with access rules
* No manual data manipulation, reducing human error


💰 Cost-Effective Design

* Uses **Firebase free tier**, eliminating server and infrastructure costs
* No biometric hardware required
* Works on existing smartphones and browsers
* Cloud-based deployment reduces maintenance overhead
* Minimal system requirements (low CPU, RAM, storage usage)


🧠 System Architecture

* **Frontend:** User interface for login, QR scanning, dashboards
* **Backend (Cloud):** Authentication, QR validation, data storage
* **Database:** Real-time cloud database for instant updates
